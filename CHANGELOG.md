# Changelog - Tala Attendance Management System

## [2025-10-13] - Project Refactoring & Bug Fixes

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

#### Clean Architecture Implementation
- **Created folder structure following SOLID principles:**
  - `Core/` - Business logic and interfaces
  - `Core/Interfaces/` - Contracts and abstractions
  - `Infrastructure/` - External concerns (DB, Logging, File System)
  - `Infrastructure/Logging/` - Logging implementations
  - `Common/` - Shared utilities and constants
  - `Presentation/` - UI Layer (existing forms)

#### New Logging System
- **Created comprehensive logging system following SOLID principles:**
  - `ILogger.vb` - Logger interface (Dependency Inversion Principle)
  - `FileLogger.vb` - File-based logger implementation (Single Responsibility)
  - `LoggerFactory.vb` - Factory pattern for creating loggers
  - `LogLevel.vb` - Enum for log severity levels
  - Thread-safe file logging
  - Automatic log folder creation
  - Daily log files: `Logs/app_log_YYYYMMDD.txt`

#### Common Utilities
- **Created reusable components:**
  - `Constants.vb` - Application-wide constants
  - `Enums.vb` - Common enumerations (UserRole, AttendanceStatus, RecordStatus)
  - `Extensions.vb` - Extension methods for type conversions and formatting

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### 1. **CRITICAL: New User Edit Issue**
**Problem:** After adding a new user, clicking Edit showed "Please select a user to edit"

**Root Cause:** 
- `login_id` column in database was not AUTO_INCREMENT
- New users were inserted with `login_id = 0`
- DataGridView Tag was not properly set when selecting rows

**Solution:**
1. **Database Fix:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE `logins` ADD PRIMARY KEY (`login_id`);
   ALTER TABLE `logins` MODIFY `login_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;
   ```

2. **Code Fix in `ManageUser.vb`:**
   - Changed `dgvManageUser.Item(0, e.RowIndex).Value` to `dgvManageUser.Rows(e.RowIndex).Cells("login_id").Value`
   - Added `SelectionChanged` event handler to update Tag when row is selected
   - Added proper null checking and type conversion
   - Added comprehensive logging to debug the issue

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/manage_user/ManageUser.vb`
- `database/tala_ams.sql` (manual ALTER TABLE required)

**Verification:**
- Used logging system to identify that `login_id` was 0 for new users
- Log output showed: `login_id=0; full_name=Mark Elliot; ...`

---

#### 2. **Build Errors: Duplicate RDLC References**
**Problem:** Build error - "Two output file names resolved to the same output path"

**Root Cause:** 
- Project file had incorrect references to RDLC files in `bin\Debug\` folder
- Files: `bin\Debug\ReportFaculty.rdlc` and `bin\Debug\ReportAttendance.rdlc`

**Solution:**
- Removed incorrect embedded resource entries from `.vbproj` file
- RDLC files should be in project root, not in bin folder

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Tala_Attendance_Management_System.vbproj`

---

#### 3. **Build Errors: Mark of the Web**
**Problem:** "Couldn't process file due to its being in the Internet or Restricted zone"

**Root Cause:** 
- Files downloaded from internet or extracted from ZIP had Windows security block

**Solution:**
- Unblocked all files using PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Unblock-File`

**Files Modified:**
- All project files (unblocked)

---

#### 4. **Missing ODBC Configuration**
**Problem:** Database connection DSN not documented

**Root Cause:** 
- ODBC DSN configuration was hardcoded but not documented

**Solution:**
- Documented ODBC configuration in `myModule.vb`
- DSN Name: `tala_ams`
- Provided instructions for MySQL ODBC Connector installation (32-bit required)

**Files Checked:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/myModule.vb`

---

### üîê Security & Access Control

#### HR Role Access Restriction
**Feature:** Hide "Manage Accounts" menu for HR users

**Implementation:**
- Added role-based UI control in `LoginForm.vb`
- HR users cannot access user management features
- Admin users have full access

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/LoginForm.vb`
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/MainForm.vb` (controls: `ToolStripSeparator1`, `tsManageAccounts`)

---

### üìù Documentation

#### Created Documentation Files
- `Infrastructure/Logging/README.md` - Logging system usage guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file
- `.gitignore` - Excluded build artifacts and logs from version control

---

### üîß Technical Debt & Improvements

#### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ Implemented SOLID principles
- ‚úÖ Added dependency injection pattern (ILogger)
- ‚úÖ Improved error handling with logging
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive debug logging for troubleshooting

#### Testing & Debugging
- ‚úÖ Added detailed logging to `ManageUser.CellClick` event
- ‚úÖ Log files show full row data for debugging
- ‚úÖ Thread-safe logging implementation

---

### üìã Required RDLC Reports (To Be Created)

Based on code analysis, the following RDLC files need to be created:

1. **ReportAttendance.rdlc**
   - Used by: `FormReportsFaculty.vb`, `FormTeacherAttendanceReports.vb`
   - Dataset: `DataSet1`
   - Fields: firstname, lastname, logDate, arrivalTime, departureTime, depStatus, attendanceID, arrStatus

2. **ReportFaculty.rdlc** (Optional)
   - Referenced in old vbproj but not currently used in code

---

### ‚ú® New Features

#### User Role Selection (2025-10-13)
**Feature:** Add role selection when creating or editing users

**Implementation:**
- Added `cboUserRole` ComboBox with options: Admin, HR, Attendance
- Role is now required when creating new users
- Role can be changed when editing existing users
- Role is properly loaded when editing a user
- Role is saved in lowercase to database for consistency

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/manage_user/AddUser.vb`
  - Added role ComboBox initialization in `AddUser_Load`
  - Added role validation in `btnSave_Click`
  - Updated INSERT query to use selected role
  - Updated UPDATE query to include role
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/manage_user/ManageUser.vb`
  - Updated `loadUserAccount` to load and set user role in ComboBox

**Usage:**
1. When creating a new user, select a role from the dropdown
2. When editing a user, the current role is pre-selected
3. Role can be changed during edit

---

### üöÄ Next Steps

#### Immediate Actions Required
1. ‚úÖ Run database ALTER TABLE commands to fix `login_id` AUTO_INCREMENT
2. ‚úÖ Wire up user role selection in Add/Edit user forms
3. ‚è≥ Create RDLC report files
4. ‚è≥ Test new user creation and editing with role selection
5. ‚è≥ Test HR role access restrictions

#### Future Improvements
- [ ] Move database connection logic to `Infrastructure/Data/`
- [ ] Create repository pattern for data access
- [ ] Add unit tests for business logic
- [ ] Implement database logger (optional)
- [ ] Add user activity audit logging
- [ ] Refactor forms to use dependency injection
