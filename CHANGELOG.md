# Changelog - Tala Attendance Management System

## [2025-10-14] - Faculty Management System Fixes & Optimizations

### üöÄ Major Faculty System Improvements

#### 1. **CRITICAL: Boolean Indexing Error - FIXED**
**Problem:** `Structure 'Boolean' cannot be indexed because it has no default property`

**Root Cause:** 
- Variable vs Function Name Confusion in `ValidationHelper.vb`
- Code was calling `regionHasProvinces(regionComboBox.Text)` instead of `RegionHasProvinces(regionComboBox.Text)`

**Solution:**
```vb
' BEFORE (Problematic):
regionHasProvinces = regionHasProvinces(regionComboBox.Text)  ' ‚ùå Trying to index Boolean variable

' AFTER (Fixed):
regionHasProvinces = RegionHasProvinces(regionComboBox.Text)  ' ‚úÖ Calling the actual function
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Common/Helpers/ValidationHelper.vb`

---

#### 2. **CRITICAL: MySQL Memory Allocation Error - FIXED**
**Problem:** `ERROR [HY001] [MySQL][ODBC 8.0(w) Driver][mysqld-5.5.5-10.4.32-MariaDB]Memory allocation error`

**Root Cause:** 
- Malformed ODBC parameters using empty parameter names `AddWithValue("@", value)`
- ODBC requires `?` placeholders, not named parameters like SQL Server

**Solution:**
```vb
' BEFORE (Problematic):
.AddWithValue("@", Trim(txtEmployeeID.Text))  ' ‚ùå Empty parameter name
.AddWithValue("@", ms.ToArray)                ' ‚ùå Causes memory issues

' AFTER (Fixed):
.Add("?", OdbcType.VarChar).Value = Trim(txtEmployeeID.Text)  ' ‚úÖ Proper ODBC syntax
.Add("?", OdbcType.Image).Value = ms.ToArray                  ' ‚úÖ Correct data type
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Presentation/Forms/Faculty/AddFaculty.vb`

---

#### 3. **CRITICAL: Faculty Records Not Appearing in DataGridView - FIXED**
**Problem:** New faculty records created successfully but not visible in the faculty list

**Root Cause:** 
- SQL query used INNER JOINs which excluded NCR records (NCR doesn't have provinces)
- `JOIN refprovince rp ON ti.provinceID = rp.id` failed for NCR faculty

**Solution:**
```sql
-- BEFORE (Problematic):
JOIN refregion rg ON ti.regionID = rg.id 
JOIN refprovince rp ON ti.provinceID = rp.id  -- ‚ùå Excludes NCR records

-- AFTER (Fixed):
LEFT JOIN refregion rg ON ti.regionID = rg.id 
LEFT JOIN refprovince rp ON ti.provinceID = rp.id  -- ‚úÖ Includes NCR records
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Presentation/Forms/Faculty/FormFaculty.vb`

---

#### 4. **CRITICAL: Birthdate Saving as 0000-00-00 - FIXED**
**Problem:** Faculty birthdate was being saved as invalid date "0000-00-00" in database

**Root Cause:** 
- Using `dtpBirthdate.Text` instead of `dtpBirthdate.Value`
- Wrong data type `OdbcType.VarChar` instead of `OdbcType.Date`

**Solution:**
```vb
' BEFORE (Problematic):
.Add("?", OdbcType.VarChar).Value = dtpBirthdate.Text  ' ‚ùå String representation

' AFTER (Fixed):
.Add("?", OdbcType.Date).Value = dtpBirthdate.Value.Date  ' ‚úÖ Proper DateTime value
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Presentation/Forms/Faculty/AddFaculty.vb`

---

#### 5. **Form Field Clearing Issues - FIXED**
**Problem:** Fields not resetting after creating/editing faculty (txtEmergencyContact, txtContactNo, cbRelationship, txtTagID, etc.)

**Root Cause:** 
- Field clearing executed AFTER `Me.Close()`, so it never ran
- `FormHelper.ClearFields()` didn't handle all control types properly

**Solution:**
```vb
' BEFORE (Problematic):
MsgBox("New record added successfully")
Me.Close()                           ' ‚ùå Form closes first
FormHelper.ClearFields(panelContainer)  ' ‚ùå Never executes

' AFTER (Fixed):
MsgBox("New record added successfully")
ClearAllFields()                     ' ‚úÖ Clear fields first
Me.Close()                          ' ‚úÖ Then close form
```

**New Methods Added:**
- `ClearAllFields()` - Comprehensive field clearing
- `ClearTextFieldSafely()` - Safe TextBox clearing
- `ResetComboBoxSafely()` - Safe ComboBox reset with bounds checking

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Presentation/Forms/Faculty/AddFaculty.vb`

---

#### 6. **Faculty Edit Form Optimization - ENHANCED**
**Problem:** Multiple performance issues and errors during faculty editing

**Issues Fixed:**
- **SelectedIndex Error:** `InvalidArgument=Value of '0' is not valid for 'SelectedIndex'`
- **Multiple Region Checks:** Redundant database calls and region validations
- **Invalid Birthdate Loading:** Future dates being loaded during edit
- **Inefficient Address Loading:** Repeated database connections

**Solutions:**
```vb
' Enhanced SetDepartmentSelection with bounds checking
Public Sub SetDepartmentSelection(departmentId As Integer?)
    If departmentId.HasValue AndAlso cboDepartment.Items.Count > 0 Then
        ' Safe search and assignment with validation
        For i As Integer = 0 To cboDepartment.Items.Count - 1
            ' Bounds checking and proper selection
        Next
    End If
End Sub

' Optimized birthdate loading with validation
If DateTime.TryParse(dt.Rows(0)("birthdate").ToString(), birthDate) Then
    AddFaculty.dtpBirthdate.Value = birthDate
Else
    AddFaculty.dtpBirthdate.Value = DateTime.Today.AddYears(-25)
End If
```

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Presentation/Forms/Faculty/AddFaculty.vb`
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Presentation/Forms/Faculty/FormFaculty.vb`

  - `Extensions.vb` - Extension methods for type conversions and formatting

---

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### 1. **CRITICAL: New User Edit Issue**
**Problem:** After adding a new user, clicking Edit showed "Please select a user to edit"

**Root Cause:** 
- `login_id` column in database was not AUTO_INCREMENT
- New users were inserted with `login_id = 0`
- DataGridView Tag was not properly set when selecting rows

**Solution:**
1. **Database Fix:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE `logins` ADD PRIMARY KEY (`login_id`);
   ALTER TABLE `logins` MODIFY `login_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;
   ```

2. **Code Fix in `ManageUser.vb`:**
   - Changed `dgvManageUser.Item(0, e.RowIndex).Value` to `dgvManageUser.Rows(e.RowIndex).Cells("login_id").Value`
   - Added `SelectionChanged` event handler to update Tag when row is selected
   - Added proper null checking and type conversion
   - Added comprehensive logging to debug the issue

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/manage_user/ManageUser.vb`
- `database/tala_ams.sql` (manual ALTER TABLE required)

**Verification:**
- Used logging system to identify that `login_id` was 0 for new users
- Log output showed: `login_id=0; full_name=Mark Elliot; ...`

---

#### 2. **Build Errors: Duplicate RDLC References**
**Problem:** Build error - "Two output file names resolved to the same output path"

**Root Cause:** 
- Project file had incorrect references to RDLC files in `bin\Debug\` folder
- Files: `bin\Debug\ReportFaculty.rdlc` and `bin\Debug\ReportAttendance.rdlc`

**Solution:**
- Removed incorrect embedded resource entries from `.vbproj` file
- RDLC files should be in project root, not in bin folder

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Tala_Attendance_Management_System.vbproj`

---

#### 3. **Build Errors: Mark of the Web**
**Problem:** "Couldn't process file due to its being in the Internet or Restricted zone"

**Root Cause:** 
- Files downloaded from internet or extracted from ZIP had Windows security block

**Solution:**
- Unblocked all files using PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Unblock-File`

**Files Modified:**
- All project files (unblocked)

---

#### 4. **Missing ODBC Configuration**
**Problem:** Database connection DSN not documented

**Root Cause:** 
- ODBC DSN configuration was hardcoded but not documented

**Solution:**
- Documented ODBC configuration in `myModule.vb`
- DSN Name: `tala_ams`
- Provided instructions for MySQL ODBC Connector installation (32-bit required)

**Files Checked:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/myModule.vb`

---

### üîê Security & Access Control

#### HR Role Access Restriction
**Feature:** Hide "Manage Accounts" menu for HR users

**Implementation:**
- Added role-based UI control in `LoginForm.vb`
- HR users cannot access user management features
- Admin users have full access

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/LoginForm.vb`
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/MainForm.vb` (controls: `ToolStripSeparator1`, `tsManageAccounts`)

---

### üìù Documentation

#### Created Documentation Files
- `Infrastructure/Logging/README.md` - Logging system usage guide

---

### üìã Required RDLC Reports (To Be Created)

Based on code analysis, the following RDLC files need to be created:

1. **ReportAttendance.rdlc**
   - Used by: `FormReportsFaculty.vb`, `FormTeacherAttendanceReports.vb`
   - Dataset: `DataSet1`
   - Fields: firstname, lastname, logDate, arrivalTime, departureTime, depStatus, attendanceID, arrStatus

2. **ReportFaculty.rdlc** (Optional)
   - Referenced in old vbproj but not currently used in code

---

### ‚ú® New Features

#### User Role Selection (2025-10-13)
**Feature:** Add role selection when creating or editing users

**Implementation:**
- Added `cboUserRole` ComboBox with options: Admin, HR, Attendance
- Role is now required when creating new users
- Role can be changed when editing existing users
- Role is properly loaded when editing a user
- Role is saved in lowercase to database for consistency

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/manage_user/AddUser.vb`
  - Added role ComboBox initialization in `AddUser_Load`
  - Added role validation in `btnSave_Click`
  - Updated INSERT query to use selected role
  - Updated UPDATE query to include role
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/manage_user/ManageUser.vb`
  - Updated `loadUserAccount` to load and set user role in ComboBox

**Usage:**

2. When editing a user, the current role is pre-selected
3. Role can be changed during edit

---

#### Proper Logout & Exit Implementation (2025-10-13)
**Feature:** Implemented proper logout and exit functionality with confirmation dialogs

**Implementation:**
- **Logout (`msLogout_Click`):**
  - Shows confirmation dialog before logging out
  - Closes all open child forms
  - Closes all application forms except MainForm and LoginForm
  - Hides MainForm and shows LoginForm
  - Clears login credentials
  - Logs all logout actions
  
- **Exit (`msExit_Click`):**
  - Shows confirmation dialog before exiting
  - Closes database connections properly
  - Exits application cleanly
  - Logs all exit actions
  
- **Form Closing (`MainForm_FormClosing`):**
  - Intercepts X button click
  - Shows "Exit Application" confirmation dialog (not logout)
  - Allows user to cancel closing
  - Closes database connections
  - Closes all child forms
  - Calls `Application.Exit()` to terminate the process
  - Does NOT show login form (application exits completely)
  - Ensures .exe process is killed properly

- **Improved Legacy LogOut Method:**
  - Added logging
  - Proper form cleanup
  - Clear login credentials

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/MainForm.vb`
  - Added logger instance
  - Implemented `msLogout_Click` handler
  - Implemented `msExit_Click` handler
  - Improved `MainForm_FormClosing` handler

- ‚úÖ All actions are logged for audit trail
- ‚úÖ Prevents accidental logout/exit
- ‚úÖ Clears sensitive data (passwords) on logout

**Behavior:**
- **Logout (msLogout):** Hides MainForm, shows LoginForm, clears credentials (app stays running)
- **Exit (msExit):** Closes database, calls `Application.Exit()` (terminates process)
- **X Button:** Same as Exit - closes database, calls `Application.Exit()` (terminates process)

**Bug Fix (2025-10-13):**
- Fixed: Application process (.exe) now properly terminates when closing MainForm
- Added `Application.Exit()` call in `MainForm_FormClosing`
- Ensures no orphaned processes remain in Task Manager

---

### üöÄ Next Steps

#### Display User's Full Name Instead of Role (2025-10-13)
**Bug Fix:** MainForm was displaying user's role instead of their actual name

**Problem:** 
- Logs showed: "User 'HR' initiated logout" instead of "User 'John Doe' initiated logout"
- `labelCurrentUser` was showing role name instead of user's full name

**Root Cause:**
- LoginForm was falling back to role name when `teacherinformation` lookup failed
- Not using the `fullname` column from `logins` table

**Solution:**
- Updated LoginForm to use `fullname` from `logins` table first
- Falls back to `teacherinformation` only if fullname is empty
- Shows "ADMIN" or "HR User" only as last resort

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/LoginForm.vb`
  - Updated admin case to use `dt.Rows(0)("fullname")`
  - Updated hr case to use `dt.Rows(0)("fullname")`
  - Added proper fallback logic

**Verification:**
- Logs now show: "User 'John Doe' initiated logout"
- MainForm displays actual user name, not role

---

#### Enhanced User Display Format (2025-10-13)
**Feature:** Display user information with role in a formatted way

**Implementation:**
- Changed label format from: `"John Doe"` 
- To: `"Logged in as: John Doe (Admin)"`
- Added `currentUserRole` property to MainForm to store user's role
- Updated logging to show: `"User 'John Doe' (Admin) initiated logout"`

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/MainForm.vb`
  - Added `currentUserRole` property
  - Updated `msLogout_Click` to extract user name and log with role
  - Updated `msExit_Click` to extract user name and log with role
  
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/LoginForm.vb`
  - Updated admin case to set label: `"Logged in as: {name} (Admin)"`
  - Updated hr case to set label: `"Logged in as: {name} (HR)"`
  - Sets `MainForm.currentUserRole` for logging purposes

**Display Examples:**
- Admin: `"Logged in as: Mark Elliot (Admin)"`
- HR: `"Logged in as: Jane Smith (HR)"`

**Log Examples:**
```
[2025-10-13 17:30:45.123] [INFO] User 'Mark Elliot' (Admin) initiated logout
[2025-10-13 17:30:47.456] [INFO] User 'Jane Smith' (HR) logged out successfully
```

---

#### Fixed Search Feature in ManageUser (2025-10-13)
**Bug Fix:** Search was not working in user management

**Problem:**
- Search feature was trying to use `CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname)` 
- But `logins` table has `fullname` column, not separate firstname/lastname
- Search would fail silently

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect column reference in search query
- Using `CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname)` instead of `fullname`

**Solution:**
- Changed search field from `CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname)` to `fullname`
- Now searches across: username, fullname, and email

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/manage_user/ManageUser.vb`
  - Updated `txtSearch_TextChanged` to use `fullname` column

**Search Now Works On:**
- Username
- Full Name
- Email Address

---

---

### üéì Faculty Form Improvements

#### Middle Name Made Optional (2025-10-13)
**Feature:** Middle name is now optional when adding/editing faculty

**Problem:**
- Middle name was required (marked with asterisk)
- Not all faculty members have middle names
- Form validation would fail if middle name was empty

**Solution:**
- Removed asterisk from middle name label (Designer)
- Updated validation to allow empty middle name
- If empty, stores NULL in database (database default is "N/A")
- Changed from storing "--" to storing NULL for better data integrity

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/AddFaculty.vb`
  - Added logic to set middle name to "--" if empty
  - Allows form submission without middle name

- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/myModule.vb`
  - Added `FormatFullName()` function to format names properly
  - Skips middle name if it's "--", "N/A", or empty/NULL
  - Added `GetNameConcatSQL()` for SQL queries
  - Example: "Mark Elliot" instead of "Mark -- Elliot" or "Mark N/A Elliot"

**Usage Examples:**

VB.NET Code:
```vb
' Format name in code
Dim fullName As String = FormatFullName("Mark", Nothing, "Elliot")
' Result: "Mark Elliot" (NULL middle name is skipped)

Dim fullName2 As String = FormatFullName("Mark", "N/A", "Elliot")
' Result: "Mark Elliot" (N/A middle name is skipped)

Dim fullName3 As String = FormatFullName("John", "Paul", "Smith", "Jr.")
' Result: "John Paul Smith Jr."
```

SQL Query:
```sql
-- Use in SQL queries
SELECT CONCAT(firstname, 
       IF(middlename IS NULL OR middlename = '' OR middlename = '--', '', CONCAT(' ', middlename)), 
       ' ', lastname) AS full_name
FROM teacherinformation
```

**Testing:**
- [ ] Create new faculty without middle name
- [ ] Edit existing faculty and remove middle name
- [ ] Verify NULL is stored in database (displays as "N/A")
- [ ] Verify display shows "Mark Elliot" not "Mark N/A Elliot"

[2025-10-13 18:30:45.456] [INFO] Faculty save initiated - Name: 'Mark Elliot', Employee ID: 'EMP001', Mode: Create
[2025-10-13 18:30:46.789] [INFO] Creating new faculty record - Name: 'Mark Elliot', Employee ID: 'EMP001'
[2025-10-13 18:30:47.012] [INFO] Faculty record created successfully - Name: 'Mark Elliot', Employee ID: 'EMP001', RFID: 'RF12345'
[2025-10-13 18:30:47.234] [INFO] AddFaculty form closing
```

**Enhanced Field Validation Logging:**
- Updated `fieldChecker()` function in `myModule.vb`
- Now logs which field failed validation
- Logs field name and panel name for easier debugging
- Optional parameter to disable logging if needed

**Validation Log Example:**
```
[2025-10-13 18:45:12.345] [WARNING] Faculty save validation failed - Required fields missing for 'Mark Elliot'
[2025-10-13 18:45:12.346] [WARNING] Field validation failed - Empty field: 'txtEmail' in panel 'panelContainer'
```

**Benefits:**

### üîß Field Validation Improvements (2025-10-13)

#### Middle Name Excluded from Required Fields
**Feature:** Updated field validation to exclude middle name fields from required validation

**Problem:**
- `fieldChecker()` function was validating ALL TextBox and ComboBox controls
- Middle name fields were being marked as required even though they should be optional
- Faculty forms would fail validation if middle name was empty

**Solution:**
- Enhanced `fieldChecker()` function in `myModule.vb`
- Added optional `excludeFields` parameter to specify fields to skip
- By default excludes common middle name field variations:
  - `txtMiddleName`
  - `txtmiddlename` 
  - `cboMiddleName`
  - `cbomiddlename`
- Maintains backward compatibility - existing calls work without changes

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/myModule.vb`
  - Updated `fieldChecker()` function signature
  - Added default excluded fields list
  - Added logic to skip validation for excluded fields
  - Uses `Continue For` to skip excluded controls

**Usage Examples:**
```vb
' Default usage - excludes middle name fields automatically
If fieldChecker(panelContainer) Then
    ' All required fields are filled (except middle name)
End If

' Custom exclusions - exclude additional fields
Dim customExclusions() As String = {"txtOptionalField", "cboOptionalCombo"}
If fieldChecker(panelContainer, True, customExclusions) Then
    ' Validation passes with custom exclusions
End If
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Middle name is now truly optional in all forms
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with existing code
- ‚úÖ Flexible - can exclude additional fields if needed
- ‚úÖ Maintains logging for validation failures
- ‚úÖ Clean code - no need to modify every form

---

### üéì Faculty Management Enhancements (2025-10-13)

#### Fixed Faculty Name Display Issue
**Bug Fix:** Faculty names were showing with extra spaces when middle name was empty

**Problem:**
- SQL query used simple `CONCAT(firstname, ' ', middlename, ' ', lastname)`
- When middle name was NULL or "--", names showed as "Mark  Elliot" (extra spaces)
- Faculty list looked unprofessional with inconsistent spacing

**Root Cause:**
- FormFaculty.vb was using basic CONCAT without handling NULL/empty middle names
- No logic to skip middle name when it's placeholder value

**Solution:**
- Updated FormFaculty.vb to use `GetNameConcatSQL()` function
- Replaced simple CONCAT with smart name formatting
- Now properly handles NULL, empty, "--", and "N/A" middle names

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/FormFaculty.vb`
  - Updated `DefaultSettings()` query to use `GetNameConcatSQL()`
  - Updated `txtSearch_TextChanged()` queries to use `GetNameConcatSQL()`
  - Added missing `Imports System.Data.Odbc`

**Before Fix:**
```
Mark  Elliot        (extra spaces)
John -- Smith       (shows placeholder)
Jane N/A Doe        (shows N/A)
```

**After Fix:**
```
Mark Elliot         (clean spacing)
John Smith          (no placeholder)
Jane Doe            (no N/A)
```

**SQL Query Improvement:**
```sql
-- Old query
CONCAT(ti.firstname, ' ', ti.middlename, ' ', ti.lastname) AS teacher_name

-- New query  
CONCAT(ti.firstname, 
       IF(ti.middlename IS NULL OR ti.middlename = '' OR ti.middlename = '--' OR UPPER(ti.middlename) = 'N/A', '', CONCAT(' ', ti.middlename)), 
       ' ', ti.lastname) AS teacher_name
```

---

#### Fixed Faculty Deletion Connection Issue
**Bug Fix:** Faculty deletion was failing with "Connection is closed" error

**Problem:**
- Delete operation was failing with: "ExecuteNonQuery requires an open and available Connection. The connection's current state is closed"
- Connection management was conflicting between delete operation and list refresh

**Root Cause:**
- `DefaultSettings()` call was happening before delete operation completed
- Connection was being closed by `loadDGV` before `ExecuteNonQuery` could run

**Solution:**
- Improved connection management in delete operation
- Ensure fresh connection for delete operation
- Close connection immediately after delete
- Move list refresh after successful deletion only
- Better error handling and logging

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/FormFaculty.vb`
  - Fixed `btnDeleteRecord_Click` method
  - Added proper faculty ID validation
  - Improved connection management
  - Enhanced error handling
  - Safe connection closing in Finally block

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ Delete operation now works reliably
- ‚úÖ Better error messages for users
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ Proper connection cleanup
- ‚úÖ List refreshes only after successful deletion

---

#### Fixed Faculty Edit Address Loading Issue
**Bug Fix:** Address fields were empty when editing faculty records

**Problem:**
- When editing faculty, address ComboBoxes (Region, Province, City, Barangay) were empty
- Validation would fail because required address fields appeared empty
- User couldn't save edited faculty records

**Root Cause:**
- EditRecord was setting ComboBox `.Text` property with ID values
- ComboBoxes need `.SelectedValue` set to ID, not `.Text`
- Address ComboBoxes weren't being loaded in proper cascade order

**Solution:**
- Created `LoadAddressComboBoxes()` method to properly load address data
- Loads ComboBoxes in correct cascade order: Region ‚Üí Province ‚Üí City ‚Üí Barangay
- Uses database lookups to get codes for dependent ComboBoxes
- Sets `SelectedValue` instead of `Text` property
- Proper connection management for each database operation

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/FormFaculty.vb`
  - Added `LoadAddressComboBoxes()` method
  - Updated `EditRecord()` to use new address loading method
  - Added `Imports System.Data.Odbc`
  - Proper connection management with `connectDB()` calls

**How Address Loading Works:**
1. **Load Region ComboBox** - All regions, select stored regionID
2. **Load Province ComboBox** - Get regionCode from regionID, load provinces for that region, select stored provinceID  
3. **Load City ComboBox** - Get provinceCode from provinceID, load cities for that province, select stored cityID
4. **Load Barangay ComboBox** - Get cityCode from cityID, load barangays for that city, select stored brgyID

**Database Queries Used:**
```sql
-- Get region code for loading provinces
SELECT regCode FROM refregion WHERE id = ?

-- Get province code for loading cities  
SELECT provCode FROM refprovince WHERE id = ?

-- Get city code for loading barangays
SELECT citymunCode FROM refcitymun WHERE id = ?
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Address fields now load correctly when editing faculty
- ‚úÖ Validation passes because ComboBoxes have proper selections
- ‚úÖ Maintains cascade relationship between address levels
- ‚úÖ Compatible with existing AddFaculty form logic
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling if address data is missing

**Testing:**
- [x] Edit existing faculty record
- [x] Verify all address fields load correctly
- [x] Verify can save without validation errors
- [x] Verify address cascade still works (changing region updates provinces, etc.)

### üîß Technical Implementation Details

#### Age Calculation Algorithm
**Implementation:** Accurate age calculation considering leap years and birthday occurrence

```vb
Public Shared Function CalculateAge(dateOfBirth As DateTime, referenceDate As DateTime) As Integer
    Dim age As Integer = referenceDate.Year - dateOfBirth.Year
    
    ' Adjust if birthday hasn't occurred this year yet
    If referenceDate.Month < dateOfBirth.Month OrElse 
       (referenceDate.Month = dateOfBirth.Month AndAlso referenceDate.Day < dateOfBirth.Day) Then
        age -= 1
    End If
    
    Return age
End Function
```

#### Validation Logic Flow
**Implementation:** Multi-layered validation with specific error handling

```vb
1. Check if date is in future ‚Üí "Invalid date of birth. Please enter a valid past date."
2. Calculate age from date of birth
3. Check minimum age (18) ‚Üí "Faculty member must be at least 18 years old. Current age: X years."
4. Check maximum age (100) ‚Üí "Faculty member cannot be older than 100 years. Current age: X years."
5. Check realistic range (>1900) ‚Üí "Invalid date of birth. Please enter a realistic date."
6. Log validation result and return success/failure
```

#### DateTimePicker Configuration
**Implementation:** Proactive prevention of invalid date selection

```vb
Private Sub ConfigureDateTimePicker()
    ' Set reasonable default (25 years old)
    dtpBirthdate.Value = DateTime.Today.AddYears(-25)
    
    ' Set date range limits
    dtpBirthdate.MinDate = New DateTime(Constants.MIN_BIRTH_YEAR + 1, 1, 1)
    dtpBirthdate.MaxDate = DateTime.Today
    
    ' Improve user experience
    dtpBirthdate.Format = DateTimePickerFormat.Long
End Sub
```
