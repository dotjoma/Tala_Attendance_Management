# Changelog - Tala Attendance Management System

## [2025-10-13] - Project Refactoring & Bug Fixes

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Improvements

#### Clean Architecture Implementation
- **Created folder structure following SOLID principles:**
  - `Core/` - Business logic and interfaces
  - `Core/Interfaces/` - Contracts and abstractions
  - `Infrastructure/` - External concerns (DB, Logging, File System)
  - `Infrastructure/Logging/` - Logging implementations
  - `Common/` - Shared utilities and constants
  - `Presentation/` - UI Layer (existing forms)

#### New Logging System
- **Created comprehensive logging system following SOLID principles:**
  - `ILogger.vb` - Logger interface (Dependency Inversion Principle)
  - `FileLogger.vb` - File-based logger implementation (Single Responsibility)
  - `LoggerFactory.vb` - Factory pattern for creating loggers
  - `LogLevel.vb` - Enum for log severity levels
  - Thread-safe file logging
  - Automatic log folder creation
  - Daily log files: `Logs/app_log_YYYYMMDD.txt`

#### Common Utilities
- **Created reusable components:**
  - `Constants.vb` - Application-wide constants
  - `Enums.vb` - Common enumerations (UserRole, AttendanceStatus, RecordStatus)
  - `Extensions.vb` - Extension methods for type conversions and formatting

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### 1. **CRITICAL: New User Edit Issue**
**Problem:** After adding a new user, clicking Edit showed "Please select a user to edit"

**Root Cause:** 
- `login_id` column in database was not AUTO_INCREMENT
- New users were inserted with `login_id = 0`
- DataGridView Tag was not properly set when selecting rows

**Solution:**
1. **Database Fix:**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE `logins` ADD PRIMARY KEY (`login_id`);
   ALTER TABLE `logins` MODIFY `login_id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;
   ```

2. **Code Fix in `ManageUser.vb`:**
   - Changed `dgvManageUser.Item(0, e.RowIndex).Value` to `dgvManageUser.Rows(e.RowIndex).Cells("login_id").Value`
   - Added `SelectionChanged` event handler to update Tag when row is selected
   - Added proper null checking and type conversion
   - Added comprehensive logging to debug the issue

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/manage_user/ManageUser.vb`
- `database/tala_ams.sql` (manual ALTER TABLE required)

**Verification:**
- Used logging system to identify that `login_id` was 0 for new users
- Log output showed: `login_id=0; full_name=Mark Elliot; ...`

---

#### 2. **Build Errors: Duplicate RDLC References**
**Problem:** Build error - "Two output file names resolved to the same output path"

**Root Cause:** 
- Project file had incorrect references to RDLC files in `bin\Debug\` folder
- Files: `bin\Debug\ReportFaculty.rdlc` and `bin\Debug\ReportAttendance.rdlc`

**Solution:**
- Removed incorrect embedded resource entries from `.vbproj` file
- RDLC files should be in project root, not in bin folder

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/Tala_Attendance_Management_System.vbproj`

---

#### 3. **Build Errors: Mark of the Web**
**Problem:** "Couldn't process file due to its being in the Internet or Restricted zone"

**Root Cause:** 
- Files downloaded from internet or extracted from ZIP had Windows security block

**Solution:**
- Unblocked all files using PowerShell: `Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Unblock-File`

**Files Modified:**
- All project files (unblocked)

---

#### 4. **Missing ODBC Configuration**
**Problem:** Database connection DSN not documented

**Root Cause:** 
- ODBC DSN configuration was hardcoded but not documented

**Solution:**
- Documented ODBC configuration in `myModule.vb`
- DSN Name: `tala_ams`
- Provided instructions for MySQL ODBC Connector installation (32-bit required)

**Files Checked:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/myModule.vb`

---

### üîê Security & Access Control

#### HR Role Access Restriction
**Feature:** Hide "Manage Accounts" menu for HR users

**Implementation:**
- Added role-based UI control in `LoginForm.vb`
- HR users cannot access user management features
- Admin users have full access

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/LoginForm.vb`
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/MainForm.vb` (controls: `ToolStripSeparator1`, `tsManageAccounts`)

---

### üìù Documentation

#### Created Documentation Files
- `Infrastructure/Logging/README.md` - Logging system usage guide
- `CHANGELOG.md` - This file
- `.gitignore` - Excluded build artifacts and logs from version control

---

### üìã Required RDLC Reports (To Be Created)

Based on code analysis, the following RDLC files need to be created:

1. **ReportAttendance.rdlc**
   - Used by: `FormReportsFaculty.vb`, `FormTeacherAttendanceReports.vb`
   - Dataset: `DataSet1`
   - Fields: firstname, lastname, logDate, arrivalTime, departureTime, depStatus, attendanceID, arrStatus

### üöÄ Next Steps

#### Display User's Full Name Instead of Role (2025-10-13)
**Bug Fix:** MainForm was displaying user's role instead of their actual name

**Problem:** 
- Logs showed: "User 'HR' initiated logout" instead of "User 'John Doe' initiated logout"
- `labelCurrentUser` was showing role name instead of user's full name

**Root Cause:**
- LoginForm was falling back to role name when `teacherinformation` lookup failed
- Not using the `fullname` column from `logins` table

**Solution:**
- Updated LoginForm to use `fullname` from `logins` table first
- Falls back to `teacherinformation` only if fullname is empty
- Shows "ADMIN" or "HR User" only as last resort

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/LoginForm.vb`
  - Updated admin case to use `dt.Rows(0)("fullname")`
  - Updated hr case to use `dt.Rows(0)("fullname")`
  - Added proper fallback logic

**Verification:**
- Logs now show: "User 'John Doe' initiated logout"
- MainForm displays actual user name, not role

---

#### Enhanced User Display Format (2025-10-13)
**Feature:** Display user information with role in a formatted way

**Implementation:**
- Changed label format from: `"John Doe"` 
- To: `"Logged in as: John Doe (Admin)"`
- Added `currentUserRole` property to MainForm to store user's role
- Updated logging to show: `"User 'John Doe' (Admin) initiated logout"`

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/MainForm.vb`
  - Added `currentUserRole` property
  - Updated `msLogout_Click` to extract user name and log with role
  - Updated `msExit_Click` to extract user name and log with role
  
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/LoginForm.vb`
  - Updated admin case to set label: `"Logged in as: {name} (Admin)"`
  - Updated hr case to set label: `"Logged in as: {name} (HR)"`
  - Sets `MainForm.currentUserRole` for logging purposes

**Display Examples:**
- Admin: `"Logged in as: Mark Elliot (Admin)"`
- HR: `"Logged in as: Jane Smith (HR)"`

**Log Examples:**
```
[2025-10-13 17:30:45.123] [INFO] User 'Mark Elliot' (Admin) initiated logout
[2025-10-13 17:30:47.456] [INFO] User 'Jane Smith' (HR) logged out successfully
```

#### Fixed Search Feature in ManageUser (2025-10-13)
**Bug Fix:** Search was not working in user management

**Problem:**
- Search feature was trying to use `CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname)` 
- But `logins` table has `fullname` column, not separate firstname/lastname
- Search would fail silently

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect column reference in search query
- Using `CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname)` instead of `fullname`

**Solution:**
- Changed search field from `CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname)` to `fullname`
- Now searches across: username, fullname, and email

**Files Modified:**
- `Tala_Attendance_Management_System/manage_user/ManageUser.vb`
  - Updated `txtSearch_TextChanged` to use `fullname` column

**Search Now Works On:**
- Username
- Full Name
- Email Address
